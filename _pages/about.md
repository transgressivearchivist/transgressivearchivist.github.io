This is my space on the web for reflecting on my lived experiences as a Jewish man with a transgender history, and considering the ways in which my experiences inform and shape my practice -- including deliberate transgressive practice -- as an information professional. 

I'm choosing not to associate my name with what I write here, though a lot of it will be re-identifiable to those of you who know me personally or professionally. Please respect my choice and understand that it is based on privacy and safety considerations that you likely do not have full knowledge of.

[Nicola Andrews'](http://nicolaandrews.net/) recent article "[It's not imposter syndrome: Resisting self-doubt as normal for library workers](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2020/its-not-imposter-syndrome/)" in __[In The Library With The Lead Pipe](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/)__ resonated with me. It got me thinking about the way my male privilege combines with my transgender history to leave me in a state of perpetual self-doubt that is invisible to and unsupported by my professional environment.

My experience of gender dysphoria was one of living as an imposter for the first 28 years of my life. The person everyone around me saw and interacted with was not who I really was. This made me feel unrecognised, invisible, alien. I was hiding in plain sight, a fraud, not the person everyone thought I was. Not being recognised for who you are does psychological damage to a person. It dents your confidence. It harms your sense of self and leads to constant, gnawing self-doubt. If I achieved success or people complimented me, these were achievements attributed to my outer imposter, the external self to which I could only relate dysphorically. The inner me remained unseen, unappreciated, and riddled with doubt.

As someone who has thought a great deal about gender, I am all too aware of patriarchal gender structures and power dynamics. Once I began being read as male, I worried that any successes I achieved or opportunities I was given were only the result of male privilege and had not really been earned by me at all. Because I had a history of doubting my own worth and merits, I continued this pattern, only now my reason for doing so was male privilege instead of gender dysphoria.
